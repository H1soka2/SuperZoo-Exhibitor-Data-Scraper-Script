Mandatory:
         Name of the company,
         LinkedIn URL,
         Company Website URL,
 
Optional:
         Location: City, State,
         Description text,
         Any "Brands" listed, captured as on field.
 

Finally data will be uploaded to a csv file. One of the optional Column will be empty if script cannot find a given argument.
